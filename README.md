# Project Exam 2 | Holidaze

## Goal
The goal of this project is to apply the skills learned over the last two years to develop a fully functional booking website. 
The primary focus is on creating the front-end application that interacts with an existing API handling bookings and managing venues.

## Brief
A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. 
Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

## API
All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project focuses on the front-end application. Refer to the Noroff API documentation for details on the auction endpoints. Noroff API documentation: https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/holidaze/bookings
